# News site

##### This is a project I created for the Technigo Web Developer Bootcamp of 2023. The assignment was to create a news site using basic HTML and CSS. I decided to create a site hosting news "articles" and images I created with AI generators.

# The problem

##### CSS Grid and Flexbox proved to be most useful for this specific project. When running into problems, I mostly turned to Google for help. I would like for my code to be a lot more streamlined and readable, and if I had more time on my hands I would polish the code. I also would like to find a solution to my font of choice not being supported by Safari.
