          <h3>
            Former President Trump Honored with Golden Statue in Pyongyang,
            North Korea
          </h3>
          <p>
            PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA — In a surprise move, the North Korean
            government unveiled a statue of former President of the United
            States, Donald Trump, in the center of Pyongyang. The statue, which
            stands at 15 feet tall, depicts President Trump with a stern look on
            his face and is adorned with gold. The statue's base is inscribed
            with the words "The Great Negotiator". The unveiling of the statue
            was attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who praised
            President Trump for his efforts to bring peace and stability to the
            Korean Peninsula and for improving relations between the two
            countries during his time as President.
          </p>
          <p class="flex-child big-article-text-desktop">
            The unveiling of the statue was met with mixed reactions. Some North
            Koreans praised the government for honoring a former US leader,
            while others criticized the decision, citing the historically
            hostile relations between the two countries. In the United States,
            the news of the statue's unveiling was met with surprise and
            confusion. Many officials and political analysts have expressed
            skepticism about the reasons behind the statue, given the
            complicated relationship between the two nations during President
            Trump's tenure. <br />
            <br />
            This move is seen as a significant change in the diplomatic
            relations between the two countries, and a clear sign of the efforts
            made by President Trump to improve the relations between the
            nations, despite facing challenges during his tenure as President.
